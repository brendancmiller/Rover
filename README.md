WaggieBot 2.0 is a project I'm working on with my daughter to help foster her interest in robotics. It is derived from the following project: http://www.hackster.io/peejster/rover
This original was built with a Raspberry Pi 2 , running an older version of Universal Windows on Windows 10 IOT. My iteration is running on a Raspberry Pi 3B with Universal Windows 6.1.5

In its current state, WaggieBot is an obstacle avoidance robot. Constantly moving until it detects an object in its path. Future iterations will incorporate a remote control app and integration with the Azure Bot Framework.
